I am translating a Markdown documentation file from Traditional Chinese into English.
Please strictly adhere to the following rules during translation:

1. **Preserve Markdown Structure**:
   - Do not alter the Markdown syntax or structure in any way.
   - Do not add, remove, or modify links, URLs, or formatting.

2. **Code Blocks**:
   - Translate comments inside code blocks, but do not touch the code itself.
   - Ensure the code remains unchanged and fully functional.

3. **Line Breaks and Blank Lines**:
   - Maintain the original line breaks and spacing.
   - Do not add or remove any blank lines.

4. **Pre-existing English Content**:
   - If a section is already in English, do not translate it. Leave it as-is.

5. **Language Consistency**:
   - Ensure the output is entirely in English. Do not include any Traditional Chinese in the result.

I will paste the Markdown content shortly. Please ensure your translation complies with all the rules above.
